# Genesis 1:26, 28: And God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness, and let them have dominion... And God blessed them; and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion...

I was touched by the word "subdue".
The first definition is most familiar:
"To conquer by force or the exertion of superior power, and bring into permanent subjection".
However, there is a second definition:
"To tame, to break by conquering a refactory temper or evil passions, to render submissive; as, to subdue a stubborn child".
Man was made to tame the earth, to conquer the tempers and evil passions of the earth.
And as man was made in God's image and likeness, we must subdue the earth with His expression.
Not with wars and politics, but with Jesus's love and patience, led by the Spirit in our spirit.

May you reign in life with Him today. Amen.
