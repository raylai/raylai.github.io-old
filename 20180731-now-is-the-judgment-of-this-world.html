<h1>John 12:31 Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the ruler of this world be cast out.</h1>

<p>Perhaps you will say, &#8220;How could the devil have been destroyed when he is still so prevailing?&#8221;
It is a lie to say that the devil is prevailing.
The Bible never says this.
Do not believe in this lie.
The Bible says that the devil has been bruised, destroyed.
His head has been crushed.
Are you going to believe your feelings or God&#8217;s Word?
God&#8217;s Word tells us that through His death on the cross Christ has destroyed the devil.
This is an accomplished fact, a fact that is included in the holy Word as the testament bequeathed to us.
We need to take this bequest by faith according to the holy Word.
(Life-study of Hebrews, pp. 92-93)</p>

<p>To me, this is like &#8220;The former CEO of this world has been cast out.&#8221;  Now we have a new CEO, Jesus!
The devil may still be hanging around, spreading lies, accusing me of doing my job poorly, and spreading rumors about office politics.
But it&#8217;s official: the Bible states that the accuser of our brothers has been fired!</p>

<p>And not only that, we have a direct line to the CEO: our spirit!
Anytime we&#8217;re unsure about how to handle a situation, anytime we are anxious, or even if we&#8217;re just bored and want to chat, He is ready and available!
Just call upon His name: Oh Lord Jesus!</p>

<p>Hallelujah, praise the Lord! Christ the victor!</p>
