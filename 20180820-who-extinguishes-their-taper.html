<h1>Who Extinguishes Their Taper?</h1>

<p>Recently I&#8217;ve been enjoying
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/hast-thou-heard-him/361522349?i=361522596">&#8220;Hast Thou Heard Him&#8221;</a>
by the
<a href="http://www.nycypcd.org/">New York City Young People</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hast thou heard Him, seen Him, known Him?<br/>
Is not thine a captured heart?<br/>
Chief among ten thousand own Him;<br/>
Joyful choose the better part.</p>

<p>Captivated by His beauty,<br/>
Worthy tribute haste to bring;<br/>
Let His peerless worth constrain thee,<br/>
Crown Him now unrivaled King.</p>

<p>&#8216;Tis that look that melted Peter,<br/>
&#39;Tis that face that Stephen saw,<br/>
&#39;Tis that heart that wept with Mary,<br/>
Can alone from idols draw:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This hymn is so sweet!
My spirit is lifted every time I sing it.</p>

<p>This hymn has some deep parts.
One of the stanzas took me a while to understand:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who extinguishes their taper<br/>
Till they hail the rising sun?<br/>
Who discards the garb of winter<br/>
Till the summer has begun?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Witness Lee wrote something related to this matter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some may say that though we cannot control natural light,
we can make light of our own by means of electricity or by burning oil lamps or candles.
However, if we wish to be enlightened in spiritual matters, we cannot do this.
We can only wait for God to shine.
If God does not enlighten us, we definitely should not manufacture light ourselves nor seek light ourselves.
Concerning this matter, Isaiah 50:10-11 says:
&#8220;Who is among you that feareth Jehovah, that obeyeth the voice of his servant?
he that walketh in darkness, and hath no light, let him trust in the name of Jehovah, and rely upon his God.
Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that gird yourselves about with firebrands;
walk ye in the flame of your fire, and among the brands that ye have kindled.
This shall ye have of my hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.&#8221;
In the entire Bible, this is the passage which speaks most clearly concerning the matter of being enlightened.
On one hand, it points out to us the proper way:
if we fear God, obey God&#8217;s voice, and suddenly fall into darkness and have no light,
we should not do anything but trust in the name of the Lord, rely upon our God, and wait for the light of God to shine.
This is because only God is light, only God is the source of light, and only in the light of God can we see light.
On the other hand, this verse also warns us that when we have no light we should not find a way out ourselves by kindling a fire or making our own light.
For if we do not wait for God, but instead gird ourselves about with self-made light,
though we may walk in the light of our own fire for a time, in the end we shall lie down in sorrow.</p>

<p>Back to stanza 5:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who extinguishes their taper<br/>
Till they hail the rising sun?<br/>
Who discards the garb of winter<br/>
Till the summer has begun?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who extinguishes their candle, in the dead of night, until the sun rises?
Only someone who knows, deep in their heart, that the sun will rise.
And when the sun rises, there will be no need for the candle whatsoever,
for the sun will illuminate everything as far as the eye can see.</p>

<p>Who discards their winter garments, in the dead of winter, until the summer begins?
Only those who are are warmed by their burning spirit in anticipation of the warm embrace of the summer.</p>

<p>Call Jesus and hear Him!</p>

<p>Seek Jesus and see Him!</p>

<p>Listen to Jesus and know Him!</p>
