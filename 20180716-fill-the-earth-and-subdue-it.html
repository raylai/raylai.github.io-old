<h1>Genesis 1:26, 28: And God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness, and let them have dominion&#8230; And God blessed them; and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion&#8230;</h1>

<p>I was touched by the word &#8220;subdue&#8221;.
The first definition is most familiar:
&#8220;To conquer by force or the exertion of superior power, and bring into permanent subjection&#8221;.
However, there is a second definition:
&#8220;To tame, to break by conquering a refactory temper or evil passions, to render submissive; as, to subdue a stubborn child&#8221;.
Man was made to tame the earth, to conquer the tempers and evil passions of the earth.
And as man was made in God&#8217;s image and likeness, we must subdue the earth with His expression.
Not with wars and politics, but with Jesus&#8217;s love and patience, led by the Spirit in our spirit.</p>

<p>May you reign in life with Him today. Amen.</p>
